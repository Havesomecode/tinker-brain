This vault demonstrates a practical second-brain workflow for a small team over two weeks of project work.

## Structure
- `00 Inbox` for quick captures
- `10 Projects` for active outcomes
- `20 Areas` for ongoing responsibilities
- `30 Resources` for references
- `40 Archive` for old or stub content

## 3-step demo flow
1. capture: open an inbox note and record context quickly
2. triage: move and refine the note into project/resource context
3. recall: use MOCs and links to retrieve what matters
